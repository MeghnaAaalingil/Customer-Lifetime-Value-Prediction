# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction


One way a business can identify target customers on which to focus is to estimate customer lifetime value. This business metric can drive everything from a company’s marketing strategy, to sales techniques, to product and service development. 
Customer lifetime value represents how much a customer is expected to spend with a company from their first to last purchase with the business.
Factors that can impact a customer’s lifetime value, include how:
- Engaged a customer is with the brand
- Much value of the products they regularly purchase from the brand
- Frequently they purchase
Companies that strategize how to increase the customer lifetime value of their most valuable customers and find ways to turn casual customers into more valuable customers, can increase their revenue.
